## 🔒 Note on Private Projects

Some of my most recent and advanced work — including research on LLM fine-tuning, distributed data pipelines, and domain-specific NLP — is part of an ongoing academic collaboration and is kept **private due to research guidelines**.

If you're interested in learning more, feel free to reach out! I'm happy to discuss the work in more detail or share examples privately when appropriate.
